                    | Presented by Rhizome, the Seven on Seven conference pairs seven leading artists with seven luminary technologists, and challenges them to make something new together – be it an application, artwork, provocation, or whatever they imagine – over the course of a single day. They unveil their creations, and discuss their process, at this intimate public event.
