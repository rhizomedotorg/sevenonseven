                "description": "Conceived at Seven on Seven 2014, and now a thriving start-up in residence at the New Museum’s NEW INC incubator, Monegraph works to solve the issues that surround ownership and monetary support of digital artworks. Anil Dash (Co-founder, ThinkUP) and artist Kevin McCoy created an application that attributes a “digital deed” to a piece of digital art, using a blockchain in a Bitcoin-like system.  This deed authenticates the artworks as original, which can then be sold to a collector, while not limiting its circulation online. Monegraph hopes to influence the way digital artists are able to monetize their work, ultimately making their artistic practices more sustainable.",

For the 2013 edition of Seven on Seven, artist Rafael Lozanzo-Hemmer teamed with Harper Reed, Chief Technology Officer for the 2012 Obama campaign, to create Friend Fracker. The Facebook app randomly chose up to 10 friends from a user's profile, and deleted them. The user would never know who was unfriended, and the friend would never be notified. The website was created take the emotional strain away from uncluttering a user's digital world, and created in response to the team's sense of \"data overload.\" While it has since been banned by Facebook, it piqued the interest of news media: in a feature on the project, Fox News dubbed the its creators \"techie people with weird ideas.\"",

They came up with Eeeeeemail – a Gmail application that randomly delivers a message from a user's sent box, anonymized, to another user. In their idea's development process, the pair analyzed specific data about their own internet-based selves, and discussed the problem of \"Fear of Missing Out\" (FOMO), an anxiety stemming from the struggle to keep up with social networking. In their resulting project, messages that the service sends out can be banal, or intimately revealing. What is important to Lund and You is that users can't edit what these emails say about who they are, before they're sent.",

Visitors can refine or expand their comparisons from the sixty countries currently available and sort by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or alphabetical order. Through an incredibly simple interface, Image Atlas raises profound questions related to language, international culture, and systems of information. Image Atlas proposes a singular method of retrieving and comparing pictures, to demonstrate the variability of language and the persistence of difference in a world supposedly flattened by the forces of the global economy. The project was further developed and exhibited online in the New Museum's First Look program curated by Lauren Cornell. In January 2013, Simon updated the website to include a memorial to Swartz.",

A visitor to the site is then confronted with a full-screen video, and an interface that only allows them to click through the tags. With each click, a narrative is formed that lasts as long as all the videos associated with that tag, or until the users clicks on to a new one. The inspiration was to create a browsing experience that mimics the jump from user to user found in ChatRoulette. In an interview on ArtFCity, referencing the minimal interface, Trecartin explains that, \"one of the things we kept talking about was wanting to see the interface move inside the content, rather than surrounding the content.\" After further development, it was exhibited in the New Museums's exhibition Free, curated by Lauren Cornell.",
